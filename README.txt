The program draws a Cosine wave for the function y= A+Bcos(x) on a window of size 480*480.

The variables A and B are the scaling factors. 
A is the center line for graph, it represents the horizontal stretch from center line. 
B is the Maximum deviation of graph from center line on Y-Axis, i.e., it represents the vertical displacement of graph from center line. 
As the center here is at 240,240:
	The Maximum Vertical Displacement needed is 240 ==> B= 240
	The Maximum Horizontal Stretch needed is 240 ==> A = 240
So, A= 240 and B = 240.
